<pre># node-touch

For all your node touching needs.

## Installing

```bash
npm install touch
```

## CLI Usage:

See `man touch`

This package exports a binary called `nodetouch` that works mostly
like the unix builtin `touch(1)`.

## API Usage:

```javascript
var touch = require(&quot;touch&quot;)
```

Gives you the following functions:

* `touch(filename, options, cb)`
* `touch.sync(filename, options)`
* `touch.ftouch(fd, options, cb)`
* `touch.ftouchSync(fd, options)`

All the `options` objects are optional.

All the async functions return a Promise.  If a callback function is
provided, then it&#x27;s attached to the Promise.

## Options

* `force` like `touch -f` Boolean
* `time` like `touch -t &lt;date&gt;` Can be a Date object, or any parseable
  Date string, or epoch ms number.
* `atime` like `touch -a` Can be either a Boolean, or a Date.
* `mtime` like `touch -m` Can be either a Boolean, or a Date.
* `ref` like `touch -r &lt;file&gt;` Must be path to a file.
* `nocreate` like `touch -c` Boolean

If neither `atime` nor `mtime` are set, then both values are set.  If
one of them is set, then the other is not.

## cli

This package creates a `nodetouch` command line executable that works
very much like the unix builtin `touch(1)`
