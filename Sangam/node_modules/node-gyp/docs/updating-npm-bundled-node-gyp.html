<pre># Updating the npm-bundled version of node-gyp

[Many issues](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/labels/ERR%21%20node-gyp%20-v%20%3C%3D%20v5.1.0) are opened by users who are
not running a [current version of node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/releases).

`npm` bundles its own, internal, copy of `node-gyp`. This internal copy is independent of any globally installed copy of node-gyp that
may have been installed via `npm install -g node-gyp`.

Generally, npm&#x27;s library files are installed inside your global &quot;node_modules&quot;, where npm is installed (run `npm prefix` and add `lib/node_modules`, or just `node_modules` for Windows). There are some exceptions to this. Inside this global `node_modules/` there will be an `npm/` directory and inside this you&#x27;ll find a `node_modules/node-gyp/` directory. So it may look something like `/usr/local/lib/node_modules/npm/node_modules/node-gyp/`. This is the version of node-gyp that ships with npm.

When you install a _new_ version of node-gyp outside of npm, it&#x27;ll go into your global node_modules, but not under the `npm/node_modules`. So that may look like `/usr/local/lib/node_modules/node-gyp/`. It&#x27;ll have the `node-gyp` executable linked into your `PATH` so running `node-gyp` will use this version.

The catch is that npm won&#x27;t use this version unless you tell it to, it&#x27;ll keep on using the one you have installed. You need to instruct it to by setting the `node_gyp` config variable (which goes into your `~/.npmrc`). You do this by running the `npm config set` command as below. Then npm will use the command in the path you supply whenever it needs to build a native addon.

**Important**: You also need to remember to unset this when you upgrade npm with a newer version of node-gyp, or you have to manually keep your globally installed node-gyp to date. See &quot;Undo&quot; below.

## Linux and macOS
```
npm install --global node-gyp@latest
npm config set node_gyp $(npm prefix -g)/lib/node_modules/node-gyp/bin/node-gyp.js
```

`sudo` may be required for the first command if you get a permission error.

## Windows

### Windows Command Prompt
```
npm install --global node-gyp@latest
for /f &quot;delims=&quot; %P in (&#x27;npm prefix -g&#x27;) do npm config set node_gyp &quot;%P\node_modules\node-gyp\bin\node-gyp.js&quot;
```

### Powershell
```
npm install --global node-gyp@latest
npm prefix -g | % {npm config set node_gyp &quot;$_\node_modules\node-gyp\bin\node-gyp.js&quot;}
```

## Undo
**Beware** if you don&#x27;t unset the `node_gyp` config option, npm will continue to use the globally installed version of node-gyp rather than the one it ships with, which may end up being newer.

```
npm config delete node_gyp
npm uninstall --global node-gyp
```
